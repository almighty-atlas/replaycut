# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

replaycut 2.0 is a rewrite of a PowerShell service (1.x) that was never
published. The 2.0 line keeps that service's HTTP API; `docs/api.md` is the
contract.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Linux, first stage.** The service builds, passes its tests and runs on
  Linux, and CI checks that next to Windows. The single-instance guard and
  `replaycut stop` work there (a lock file under `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` and
  SIGTERM), the address for other devices carries the real host name, a
  start without a terminal opens the browser like the Windows shortcut,
  the OBS profiles are read from `~/.config/obs-studio` (or the Flatpak's
  copy) and the default clip folder is the XDG videos directory. Secrets,
  notifications, the clipboard under Wayland, GPU encoding through VAAPI,
  autostart, the installer and the tray follow in the next stages; until
  then those report that they are not available on this platform.

## [3.0.1] - 2026-09-08

Two things 3.0.0 got wrong, found by putting a real 2.x state next to real
recordings. 3.0.0 was published but never signed, so this is the first 3.0
anyone can install.

### Fixed

- Rendering a cut no longer marks its clip done. "Afterwards" belongs to the
  share row; a render often happens days later and says nothing about the
  clip. (The endpoint still takes `after`, the page no longer sends it.)
- The migration lists the clips whose recording is long gone. Their old
  shares hung under a clip the page never showed, so they were only
  reachable on Activity; they now appear under "Done" with their links,
  their title and the day they were recorded (read out of the file name).
  A cut from before 3.0 has no cut file, says so and offers "Marks" instead
  of "Render": the range goes back on the timeline and one Share makes it.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-09-08

Cut, then decide. A clip used to be one dialog on a five-minute recording:
pick a range, pick the audio, upload, and whatever you did not decide then
was gone with the recording. 3.0 puts a **cut** in between - the range as its
own file, the picture untouched and every audio track along - and renders
everything from that. The same cut goes to Nextcloud today and to YouTube as
a Short tomorrow, with another audio mix, long after the recording is in the
recycle bin. **Save cut** saves a range while you play and renders nothing;
the clips page shows what came out of every cut.

The list keeps itself: a shared clip is done and out of the way, grouped by
the evening it belongs to, one click back. **Activity** is the new page for
"what did I send where".

**Your state moves.** Titles, the seen list and the share history leave their
three JSON files for `replaycut.db` beside the settings. The first start
imports them and moves the old files to `backup-2.x\`, so an installation of
2.x that is put back finds its state where it left it. The history is no
longer capped at 200 entries.

### Added

- **Every share keeps its cut.** The range you pick becomes a file of its
  own first - `.cuts\<id>.mkv` in the clip folder, the recording's picture
  and *all* its audio tracks, copied, not re-encoded - and the upload is
  rendered from that. So audio mode, 9:16 and quality are decisions you can
  take again later: the cut is enough, the five-minute recording is not
  needed any more.
- **Save cut**: save a range while you play and render it after the game -
  to any target, with another audio mix or as a Short, as often as you like.
- **Shared clips leave the list.** A clip you have shared is done and is out
  of the way; `?done=1` lists the done ones, and one call brings a clip back.
  "Afterwards" per share decides between keeping it, marking it done and
  moving the recording to the recycle bin - the new setting
  `cleanup.afterShare` (default: done) is what the share row starts with.
  `cleanup.recycleDoneAfterDays` does the same on a timer.
- Deleting a clip has a reach: `?scope=clip` recycles only the recording and
  leaves the cuts, so the clip can still be rendered and published;
  `?scope=all` (the default, as before) takes everything with it. A single
  cut can go on its own with `DELETE /api/cuts/<id>`.
- A recording that disappears from the folder no longer takes its cuts with
  it: the clip stays in the list, marked done, with everything it produced.
- Diagnostics: a line for the cuts - how many files, how much space, how
  many the service knows about - with a warning from 10 GB on.
- The history keeps every entry now instead of the newest 200, and
  `GET /api/history` takes `limit` and `before` to walk back through it.
- **The clips page was rebuilt.** One list with a filter (Active / Done) and
  a heading per day, badges for the cuts and the targets a clip went to; the
  clip itself shows its cuts underneath, each with what came out of it and a
  "Render" of its own. "Save cut" and "Afterwards" sit next to Share, and a
  clip whose recording is gone shows its thumbnail and keeps its cuts.
- **New page: Activity.** What is running with a way to cancel it, and every
  output ever made - newest first, filtered per target, one click to the clip
  it came from. It replaces the "Shared" list on the clips page.

### Changed

- **replaycut keeps its state in one file.** Clip titles, which clips have
  already been announced and the share history moved out of three JSON files
  and into `replaycut.db` next to the settings. The first start of 3.0
  imports the old files and moves them to `backup-2.x\`, so an installation
  of 2.x put back later finds its state where it left it.
- The share progress has one more step, "Cut", before "Encode". It takes
  about a second and needs no graphics card. What comes out is frame for
  frame what 2.8 produced.

### Removed

- The "Shared" section of the clips page: its entries are on Activity now,
  and under the cut they came from on the clip itself.

### Fixed

- Settings: changing how long presigned S3 links stay valid can be saved
  again - the value went out as text and the service refused it.

## [2.8.0] - 2026-09-07

Secure by default. replaycut now listens on your PC only until you open it
up, and opening it up is one switch that asks for a password first. The
everyday way onto a phone is no longer typing that password: the phone
asks, your PC shows the request with a code and the device's name, and one
click lets it in - or the phone scans the QR code, which signs it in on the
spot. Settings lists every signed-in device and lets you sign one out.
Nothing about your clips or the sharing changed.

### Added

- **replaycut now listens on this PC only.** A new installation is not
  reachable from the network until you turn it on - in the setup wizard or
  under Settings › Access - and turning it on sets a password first and
  then asks Windows for the firewall rule. The installer no longer creates
  that rule on its own.
- Settings › Signed-in devices: every browser that may use replaycut, with
  its name, address and when it was last seen, one "Sign out" per device
  and "Sign out everywhere".
- Diagnostics: three new lines - where the service listens (a failure when
  it is open to the network without a password), whether the firewall rule
  exists, and how the device login is doing.
- **Sign in on your phone without typing the password.** The login page
  offers "Ask" plus the name of your PC: the PC shows a notification, the
  open UI a card and the tray an entry, all with the same four-character
  code and with the device's name and address. One click on Allow and the
  phone is in. A request runs out after two minutes.
- The QR code in the wizard and in the settings signs a phone in when it
  is scanned: its address carries a token that is good once and for two
  minutes. Only this PC and signed-in devices get such a code.
- `requireLoginOnLoopback` in the settings: ask for the password on this PC
  as well, for a Windows account other people use.
- "Generate one for me" next to the password fields in the wizard and in
  the settings: four words from a built-in list, shown once in clear text.
- `allowedHosts` in the settings: names this replaycut answers to besides
  `localhost`, its own name and any address - for an own DNS name or a
  reverse proxy.

### Changed

- An installation that is reachable from the network without a password
  keeps working, but says so: a red banner with "Set a password" and "This
  PC only", one notification per start, and a failure in the diagnostics.
- A request that names a host this replaycut does not answer to is refused
  with 421. That closes DNS rebinding, where a page in your browser uses
  its own name to reach the service on your PC.
- A password is 8 to 128 characters now, and there are no rules about
  digits or symbols: length is what counts.
- Signed-in devices are recorded with a name ("iPhone, Safari"), their
  browser, their address and when they were last seen. Sessions from
  earlier versions keep working.
- More than 30 failed logins from all addresses together within five
  minutes pause the password login for ten minutes.
- The size estimate in the share row learns from your own shares: the job
  records the recording's codec and bitrate (`codec`, `sourceKbps`), and
  the row uses the median ratio of the last plain H.264 shares of that
  codec instead of a fixed factor per codec.

### Fixed

- The page is mobile-friendly again: 2.7.0 shipped with a broken viewport
  meta tag, so phones rendered the desktop layout scaled down.
- The "Limits" fields on the storage cards save from the settings page
  again; 2.7.0 sent the height as text and the service answered 400.

- A restart (update, settings, `replaycut stop`) no longer waits up to 5 s
  while a browser has the player open on a long clip: the shutdown now
  gives open connections one second, which is all the restarting request
  needs.
- "Post to ..." shows its result on the result card as well: the status
  reaches `last` (what the card shows after a reload), the card re-renders
  after the click, and a status such as "Discord: Link posted" or "Posted
  (HTTP 200)" is no longer drawn as a failure.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-09-06

Quality first: a share now looks like the recording, on every target,
and space limits belong to the target that needs them. Posting to Discord
and friends happens for the quick share only; everything else asks.

### Changed

- Shares keep the recording's resolution and frame rate and are encoded in
  the encoder's quality mode: no more 1080p and 6000 kbit/s by default,
  the size follows the picture. The global "Video bitrate" setting
  (`shareKbps`) is gone; every storage card has an optional "Limits"
  section (max height, max bitrate) for the places where space matters.
  A "Publish to" onto a target with limits cuts the clip again within
  them.
- Only the quick share (the Share button's target) posts to Discord,
  Telegram and webhooks automatically; shares from the menu and "Publish
  to" stay quiet, and the result card and the history offer "Post to ..."
  instead (`POST /api/jobs/<id>/post`).
- The share mode "Fast copy" is now called "As recorded (no re-encode)".
- The Share menu says which target posts automatically, the progress card
  shows "no auto-post" for the others, and the size estimate accounts for
  the recording's codec (an AV1 recording grows about 2.5x as H.264).

### Fixed

- The stage list under the progress bar broke its layout as soon as a
  stage was done: the wizard's "done" page style leaked into it.

## [2.6.1] - 2026-09-06

### Fixed

- "Publish to ..." on a history entry from before the last restart answered
  "unknown job"; the source is now read from the history as well.

### Changed

- `docs/privacy.md` states what replaycut stores and sends, and
  `docs/youtube.md` names the home page and privacy URLs Google wants
  before an app can be published.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-09-06

Beyond the cloud folder: a share can become a YouTube video (a vertical cut
a Short) or a post on X, the link can go to Telegram or any webhook next
to Discord, the finished file downloads straight to the phone, and a
browser that cannot play the recording gets a playable copy on demand.

### Added

- YouTube as a share target: every share is uploaded as its own video
  (unlisted by default, private or public by choice), title from the clip,
  description from a template, link `youtu.be/<id>`. Uses your own Google
  client because of YouTube's upload quota; connected with a code at Google
  like OneDrive, or, with a Desktop client, in the browser on this PC
  (loopback login with PKCE: `POST /api/oauth/<provider>/loopback`,
  `GET /oauth/<provider>/callback`). `docs/youtube.md` walks through the
  five-minute setup.
- X as a share target: every share becomes a post with the video attached
  (chunked media upload, text from a template), link `x.com/<user>/status/
  <id>`; connected in the browser on this PC. Needs a build with the
  replaycut app's client id.
- Telegram as a notify integration: a bot posts the link into a chat,
  group or channel (`integrations.telegram`, token as `telegramToken`,
  `POST /api/test/telegram`).
- Generic webhook as a notify integration: a JSON `POST` per share to any
  URL, signed with `X-Replaycut-Signature` when a secret is stored, for
  n8n, Home Assistant, Zapier or a Matrix bridge (`integrations.webhook`,
  `POST /api/test/webhook`).
- Download: the result card and the history offer the finished MP4 as a
  download (`GET /api/jobs/<id>/file`); on a phone it lands in the gallery,
  ready for TikTok, Instagram or WhatsApp.
- Playable preview: when the browser cannot decode the recording (AV1 on
  an iPhone), the player offers "Make a playable preview", a 720p H.264
  copy made on the PC and kept next to the preview (`clip.previewH264`,
  `POST /api/clips/<base>/preview`). `previewH264: always` in the settings
  makes it right after every recording with idle priority.
- Vertical cut: "Vertical 9:16 (Short)" in the share row crops a full-height
  window (position by slider, shown over the player) and scales it to
  1080x1920 - a Short on YouTube, or a file for TikTok, Reels and WhatsApp
  (`vertical` and `verticalPos` in `POST /api/share` and the job).

### Changed

- The Integrations tab lists YouTube and X under Storage, Telegram and
  Webhook under Notify; the OneDrive and YouTube cards share one connect
  flow. The delete dialog's "also remove" now names every storage, not
  only Nextcloud.
- Notify integrations receive the share as structured data (title, clip,
  target, link, time); the Discord post itself is unchanged.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-09-05

Share where you like: every configured storage is a target with its own
entry in the Share menu, a finished clip can be published to another one,
and three new storages join Nextcloud - OneDrive (connected with a code at
Microsoft), any S3-compatible bucket and any WebDAV server.

### Added

- Share targets: every configured storage is a target, `POST /api/share`
  takes `target` (a storage id or `file`), the default is the storage marked
  "quick share" in the settings. `config.targets` lists the integrations
  with their state.
- Publish again: `POST /api/jobs/<id>/publish` sends the finished file of a
  share to another storage without cutting it again.
- OneDrive as a storage: connect with a code at Microsoft (device flow, works
  from a phone), uploads go to `Apps/replaycut/<month>/` with a link anyone
  can open. `GET /api/oauth/<provider>`, `POST .../start`, `POST
  .../disconnect`. Needs a build with a client id.
- S3-compatible storage (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, MinIO, Wasabi):
  SigV4-signed uploads to `<prefix>/<month>/`, links from a public URL or
  presigned with an expiry; `POST /api/test/s3` checks bucket and keys.
- Generic WebDAV storage: any DAV server plus a public URL that serves the
  folder; `POST /api/test/webdav` checks server and login.
- Deleting a clip with "also remove from storage" now removes the remote
  copies from every storage its shares went to.

### Changed

- The post stage of a job is called `notify` (was `discord`); the status
  text stays in `discord`. Settings gain `integrations.nextcloud.quickShare`
  and `integrations.discord.autoPost`, both default on.
- Integrations tab in two groups, Storage and Notify, with "Quick share
  target" and "Post automatically" switches; the Share button gets a menu
  with the other storages and "file only"; result card and history show the
  target and offer "Publish to ..." for every other storage.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-09-05

Cutting gets comfortable: shares queue up and can be cancelled, every clip
has a picture, the Nextcloud quota sits in the header, a fast copy mode
skips the re-encode, the GPU decodes where it can, and the page hears about
changes the moment they happen.

### Added

- Shares queue up instead of answering "a share is already running": the
  Share button stays usable, the card shows the place in the queue, and the
  next job starts as soon as the running one ends (`position` in the
  answer and the job, `queue` in `GET /api/clips`).
- Cancel a share: `POST /api/jobs/<id>/cancel` and the Cancel button on the
  progress card. Waiting jobs leave the queue at once; a running encode or
  upload is stopped and its partial output removed.
- Thumbnails: every clip shows a picture from 10 s before its end in the
  list and as the player poster (`thumb` on the clip, `GET /media/<base>.jpg`).
- The Nextcloud quota in the header ("Nextcloud 63 %", yellow from 80 %,
  red from 95 %), refreshed in the background (`config.quota`).
- Fast copy: a share mode that keeps the OBS video stream instead of
  re-encoding (keyframe-accurate, `mode: copy`, `actualStart` in the job).
  The choice is remembered in the browser; the default stays H.264.
- GPU decoding: the encoder detection now tries the full GPU path of each
  vendor with a real clip (AMD `d3d11va`, NVIDIA `cuda` with `scale_cuda`,
  Intel `qsv`) and falls back to software decoding per share when it fails.
  On an AMD card the AV1 decode moves off the CPU (13 s instead of 42 s CPU
  time for 30 s of 1440p60). `hwaccel` gains `auto` (the default) and `none`.
- `replaycut bench`: encodes part of the newest clip with every profile and
  prints wall time, CPU time and speed.
- The page listens to `GET /api/events` (Server-Sent Events) instead of
  asking every 3 s: changes show up at once, an idle page costs nothing,
  and a restart no longer waits for open connections. Polling stays as the
  fallback.
- The title field suggests the recording day and time as a placeholder;
  Enter on the empty field takes it.
- A keyboard shortcut list behind the "?" button and the "?" key.

### Changed

- Contract: a second `POST /api/share` while a job runs answers 202 with a
  queue position (409 only for the same cut twice).

### Fixed

- "Update now" on a release that has no signature yet ends in an error
  ("not signed yet") instead of waiting forever.

## [2.3.1] - 2026-09-05

A small release to prove the one-click update from 2.3.0.

### Fixed

- README and CHANGELOG: the install path `%LOCALAPPDATA%\replaycut\app` had
  lost its backslashes.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-09-05

The one-click update and the complete tray menu. From this release on,
every release is signed: the updater installs only what the maintainer's
minisign key vouches for.

### Added

- One-click update: `GET /api/update` and `POST /api/update/{check,download,install,seen}`.
  The service downloads the release ZIP, verifies the minisign signature of
  `SHA256SUMS` and the hash, unpacks, checks the new executable and restarts
  into it. Releases without a valid signature are never installed.
- The update banner: "Update now" runs the whole update with a progress bar
  and reloads the page on the new version; "What's new" shows the release
  notes; after an update the page says so once. Settings › General has
  "Check for updates now" with the time of the last check.
- The tray menu is complete: Open, Copy address, Show QR code, Pause
  scanning, Check for updates (with a notification for the outcome), Open
  log folder, Quit. The tooltip says "paused" and "update available".
- `POST /api/scanning { paused }` and `config.scanning`: pause the folder
  scan from the tray or the API; the UI shows a banner with "Resume".

### Changed

- The address dialog shows no QR code while replaycut listens on this PC
  only; it says how to change that instead.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-09-04

The OBS integration: replaycut talks to OBS through obs-websocket, saves
replays without simulated key presses, shows when the replay buffer is
stopped and compares the OBS profile with what it expects. Read-only; the
only actions are saving a replay and starting the buffer.

### Added

- OBS integration, part 1: the service connects to obs-websocket 5 on this PC
  (`obs` in settings.json, default `localhost:4455`, password as the
  credential `replaycut/obs-websocket`), keeps reconnecting with a backoff,
  and answers F9 through `SaveReplayBuffer` when connected - with a clear 409
  while the replay buffer is stopped - instead of a simulated key press; the
  key press stays as the fallback. `config.obs` reports the connection.
  A saved replay wakes the scanner at once; a stopped buffer raises a
  desktop notification. Contract: docs/api.md "Since 2.2".
- OBS integration, part 2: the OBS page reads profile, recording folder,
  format, encoder, video settings and the audio-track layout through the
  connection and compares them with what replaycut expects - every
  difference with the OBS menu path, plus the buttons "Start replay buffer"
  and "Use this folder in replaycut"; the top bar shows OBS, the clips page
  warns while the buffer is stopped, the wizard uses the connection, the
  diagnostics row is real. `GET /api/obs`, `POST /api/obs/replay-buffer/start`,
  `/reconnect`, `/refresh`, `/adopt-folder`. Nothing in OBS is written.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-09-04

Setup in the browser, settings at runtime, an optional password, a
diagnostics page and the new design. Rollout to the group still waits for
the one-click update.

### Added

- Settings change at runtime: `GET/PUT /api/settings` (everything but port,
  bind and the UI file takes effect at once), `POST /api/test/nextcloud` and
  `/api/test/discord`, `GET /api/addresses` with a QR code, `GET /themes/<name>.css`
  from the data directory, `POST /api/restart`. Contract: docs/api.md "Since 2.1".
- Optional password for other devices: argon2id hash in settings.json, 30-day
  session cookie, login throttle; this PC (loopback) never needs it. Every
  cross-site write is refused by an Origin check, password or not.
- `setupDone` and `theme` in settings.json; the page routes `/setup`,
  `/settings`, `/diagnostics`, `/login` serve the UI file.
- Local mode without integrations has a way out of the browser: "Open folder"
  and "Copy file" on the result (`POST /api/jobs/<id>/open-folder` and
  `/copy-file`; the file lands in the clipboard as a file object, Ctrl+V in
  Discord attaches it).
- The UI moves to the design system (docs/design): top bar with the pages,
  banners instead of the status block, the clip list as a collapsed panel
  beside the game, a login page, themes from the data directory.
- Setup wizard at `/setup` (OBS folder from the profile, live check for the
  first replay with codec and browser playability, integrations with tests,
  password, addresses and QR code) and the settings page at `/settings`
  (General and Integrations, changes apply at once, restart button for port
  and bind). `GET /api/setup/obs` reads the OBS profiles; clips carry codec,
  size and frame rate.
- Diagnostics page at `/diagnostics` and `GET /api/diagnostics`: eleven
  checks with a fix per problem and a text copy without secrets;
  `replaycut test` prints that text when the service runs.
- A fresh installation opens the browser setup; a migrated one counts as set
  up. `replaycut setup` points at the wizard.
- `docs/design`: the design system for the web UI - tokens, component sheet,
  page mockups and icon sources - and `docs/themes.md`, the theme format.

### Changed

- New application and tray icons (play mark with cut marks, amber on a dark
  tile) in six sizes up to 256 px; the tray states "job running" and "last
  job failed" carry an amber or a red dot. Rendered from the SVG sources in
  `docs/design/icons` by `mkico`.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-09-04

First public release: the Rust service, the installer and the migration
from the 1.x PowerShell service.

### Added

- Update hint: a minute after start and then daily the service asks GitHub
  for the latest release; a newer one appears as `config.update` in
  `/api/clips` (documented in `docs/api.md`, covered by the contract suite)
  and as a dismissable banner above the clip list. `checkUpdates: false`
  switches the check off. Nothing is downloaded.
- Windows integration, part 2: `replaycut install` (idempotent, per user, no
  admin except the optional firewall rule): copies the program to
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\replaycut\app`, writes start menu and desktop shortcuts
  with the AppUserModelID, registers the notification app id, asks about
  autostart (HKCU Run entry, default off) and the firewall rule (one UAC
  prompt, private profile), starts the service and opens the page;
  `replaycut uninstall` (`--purge` also removes settings, state, logs and
  credentials); `replaycut autostart on|off|status`; migration from the 1.x
  PowerShell service (task arguments, state files, credentials, task and
  firewall cleanup); `install.cmd` and `uninstall.cmd` for the release ZIP.
- Windows integration, part 1: the executable runs without a console window
  and attaches to the terminal it was started from for `--help`, `setup`,
  `test`, `stop` and log output; only one instance runs at a time (a second
  start opens the browser); a tray icon with Open, Copy address and Quit,
  a tooltip with the clip count or share progress and a badge while a share
  runs or after a failed one; `replaycut stop` ends the running service
  through a named event; desktop notifications for saved clips and share
  results (WinRT toasts, shown once the app is registered by the installer);
  `--no-browser`; the log records the shutdown reason and panics with a
  backtrace; fatal start-up errors show a dialog when there is no console.
- Service core, part 4: resource limits for ffmpeg (`ffmpegPriority`,
  default below normal; `ffmpegThreads`, default half the cores) so a share
  does not stall the game; `docs/settings.md`; idle footprint of the release
  build measured and recorded in the README.
- Service core, part 3: real integrations. Nextcloud storage (WebDAV upload
  into `<folder>/<YYYY-MM>/`, public link created or reused, remote delete)
  and Discord notify (webhook post with the display name as user name).
  Credentials live in the Windows Credential Manager under
  `replaycut/nextcloud` and `replaycut/discord-webhook`; `replaycut setup`
  configures both on the console, `replaycut test` checks them.
- Service core, part 2: the share pipeline. `POST /api/share` validates and
  registers a job (202, 409 while a job runs, 404 unknown clip, 400 invalid
  selection or audio mode), encodes with ffmpeg and live progress, then runs
  the storage and notify integrations when enabled, records history (200
  entries) and keeps the last 30 jobs. `--dry-run` uses simulated
  integrations with `dry-run.invalid` links. `DELETE ...?nextcloud=1`
  removes remote copies through the storage integration. The contract suite
  passes 11/11 against the Rust service in dry-run mode.
- Service core, part 1: `replaycut` binary with settings.json, rolling log,
  folder scanner (change notifications plus polling, 2-second age and
  exclusive-open rule), preview remux, and the read side of the API:
  `GET /`, `/api/clips`, `/api/history`, `/api/jobs/<id>`, `/media/<base>.mp4`
  with range requests, clip titles, delete to the recycle bin, `/api/save`
  (F9 to OBS), 404 handling. `--dry-run` simulates hotkey and integrations.
- `ui/index.html`: the browser UI, translated to English, logic unchanged.
- Repository skeleton: Cargo workspace with the `replaycut` binary crate
  (placeholder) and the `replaycut-api-tests` crate.
- `docs/api.md`: the HTTP API contract, transcribed from the 1.4 service.
- Black-box API test suite (`cargo test`, configured via `BASE_URL` and
  `CLIP_DIR`) covering clip discovery, preview range requests, titles, the
  share pipeline, the single-job rule (409), delete, `/api/save` and 404s.
